# 🔐 Beginner Caesar Cipher

This is a beginner-level **Caesar Cipher** project created in Python.  
The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

## How it works

- You can **encode** (encrypt) or **decode** (decrypt) a message.  
- Enter your message (letters, numbers, and symbols are allowed).  
- Choose a **shift number** to determine how much each letter will move.  
- The program will output the transformed text.
