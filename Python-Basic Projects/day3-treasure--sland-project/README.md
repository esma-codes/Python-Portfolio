# Treasure Island Project

Welcome to the Treasure Island adventure game!  
Your mission is to find the treasure by making the right choices.

---

## How It Works
1. The player starts at a crossroad and chooses "left" or "right".  
2. If "left", the player reaches a lake and can "wait" for a boat or "swim" across.  
3. After reaching the island, the player chooses a door: "Blue", "Yellow", or "Red".  
4. Depending on the choices, the player either wins or loses the game.  
5. The game uses `input()` for user decisions and `if-elif-else` statements for flow control.
